# Learning To Program With Rust
This repository will serve as a means of exploration and application of the 
programming language [Rust](). General notes will be taken to ultimately 
comprise a set of insights which will be formulated into opinions, 
conversation, and publication. This is by no means meant to be a source of
authority on the language, rather, a general exploration of the shared and
independent principals of Rust with regard to other languages I am familiar
with.

# Notes
General notes can be found in the learning directory.

# Application
Application of the learned principals can be found in the app directory
